# Global freshwater insect diversity and its drivers

## Project Overview 
This is a project to explore global freshwater insect diversity and the drivers behind it. Key environmental and anthropogenic factors affecting freshwater insect diversity were revealed by analyzing the diversity of freshwater insects in different regions of the globe (extracted from the EPTO database:https://glowabio.org/project/epto_database/).

## Environmental Requirements 
This project uses the R (verson 4.3.2) for data analysis, so R and some specific R packages need to be installed. 

## Description
All biotic and abiotic data used in this project were obtained from open databases and literature. Please prepare the necessary raw data and R packages prior to analysis, see below:

install.packages(c('dplyr', 'tidyverse', 'vegan', 'lubridate', 'data.table', 'BAT', 'iNEXT.3D', 'ggplot2' 'ggvenn', 'spatialreg', 'spdep'))
